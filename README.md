Regression Trees for Predictive Modeling
Welcome to the Regression Trees project! This repository demonstrates how regression trees, a type of decision tree algorithm, can be applied for predictive modeling tasks. Explore how machine learning can make data-driven predictions more accurate and interpretable using Scikit-learn's powerful tools.

📌 Highlights
Data Preparation: Handles and preprocesses data to ensure clean and structured inputs for modeling.
Model Training & Tuning: Builds and trains regression trees, tuning parameters like max_depth and min_samples_split for optimal performance.
Performance Metrics: Evaluates models with metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² to assess predictive accuracy.
Visualization: Includes tree structures and feature importance plots for better model interpretability.
🚀 Features
🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
Visualizes relationships in the dataset to uncover trends and patterns.
Summarizes data with descriptive statistics for deeper insights.
🤖 Machine Learning Workflow
Trains regression tree models step-by-step using Scikit-learn.
Implements hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.
📊 Evaluation
Measures model performance using train/test data.
Highlights overfitting and underfitting behavior based on evaluation results.
